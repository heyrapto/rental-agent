1) *One‑page Overview* 
 *Problem* : Rental disputes often arise from missing or alterable records (contracts, payments, communications). Immutable, timestamped evidence reduces friction and cost.

 *Solution* : An AO autonomous agent that records and manages rental contracts, payment receipts (including USDA stablecoin), communications, and maintenance workflows, storing all evidence on Arweave permanently.

 *Users* : Landlords, Tenants; optional Property Managers and Mediators.

2) *Functional Requirements* 
A. *Identity and Roles* 

Roles: Landlord, Tenant, Manager, Agent Admin.

Wallet‑based auth (Arweave wallet address) and role binding per lease record.

B. *Lease Lifecycle* 

Create lease draft (metadata + PDF/HTML body hash).

Invite counter‑party; both sign digitally; agent verifies signatures; persist final lease and metadata to Arweave.

Versioning: amendments create new immutable objects linked via parent_tx.

C. *Payments* 

Accept rent and deposit in multiple assets with emphasis on USDA stablecoin; confirm on-chain payment; generate immutable receipt stored on Arweave; update lease balance and status.

Escrow flows: hold security deposit in USDA escrow; programmable release at lease end or partial release after deduction.

D. *Communications & Maintenance* 

In‑app messaging; every message appended and anchored to Arweave with conversation/thread IDs.

Maintenance ticketing: create, assign, status transitions, photos/doc uploads; all state changes logged immutably.

E. *Dispute Package* 

On request, assemble signed, timestamped bundle of all relevant artifacts (lease, receipts, messages, tickets) with Merkle root; publish to Arweave for third‑party review.

F. *Autonomy & Uptime* 

Scheduler inside AO agent: monthly rent reminders, overdue notices, deposit release checks, and SLA pings.

Must operate autonomously for 72+ hours with retries and backoff; logs and metrics written to Arweave/Gateway per interval.

3) *Non‑Functional Requirements* 
 *Permanence* : All critical artifacts must be stored in Arweave with content hash, tags, and indexes to enable retrieval.

 *Security* : Signature verification on every state‑mutating request; access control lists per lease.

 *Privacy* : Store PII minimally; consider encrypting file payloads client‑side and persisting ciphertext + access policy off‑chain; publish only necessary metadata hashes.

 *Cost* : Minimize AR storage by compressing documents and batching logs.

 *Observability* : Message traces and state snapshots for debugging; qualifies for Best Docs when documented thoroughly.

4) *Architecture* 
 *AO Agent* (AOS/TypeScript or Lua): HTTP message handlers for actions (createLease, signLease, recordPayment, postMessage, createTicket, closeTicket, buildDisputePackage). Internal scheduler for reminders.

 *Storage* : Arweave writes via SDK; structured metadata tags (leaseId, party, action, txType).

 *Payments* :

Stablecoin: USDA payment adapters; confirm tx via USDA APIs/contract events; produce receipt with tx hash and chain id.

Extensible payment interface for AR/USDC later.

 *Indexer* : Lightweight service that reads Arweave tags to build searchable indexes for the frontend (optional for hackathon if queries are manageable).

5) *Data Model* (key records)
Lease: leaseId, landlordAddr, tenantAddr, termsHash, start/end dates, rent, currency, deposit, status, signatures[], arTxId.

Payment: leaseId, payer, amount, currency, chainId, txHash, confirmedAt, receiptArTxId.

Message: leaseId, sender, contentHash, createdAt, arTxId.

Ticket: ticketId, leaseId, title, descriptionHash, status, evidenceArTxIds[], events[], arTxId.

DisputePackage: leaseId, includedArTxIds[], merkleRoot, packageArTxId.

6) *API Contract* (HTTP message passing on AO)
POST /agent

Action: createLease | signLease | recordPayment | postMessage | createTicket | updateTicket | buildDisputePackage

Headers: x-sender-wallet, x-sig, x-timestamp

Body: JSON per action

Response: { ok, leaseId/ticketId, arTxId, error? }

Examples:

createLease: { landlordAddr, tenantAddr, terms, rent, currency: “USDA”, deposit }

recordPayment: { leaseId, payer, amount, currency: “USDA”, chainId, txHash }

All successful mutations trigger a write to Arweave and return arTxId for user verification# rental-agent
